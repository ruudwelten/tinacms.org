title: Tina Cloud Beta FAQ

## What is the Tina Cloud private beta program?

The Tina Cloud Private Beta program gives early adopters the chance to build visual content editing with our Git-backed content API before it's launched!

Tina Cloud brings together the flexibility of Tina's open-source content editing tools with an expressive GraphQL API for your file-based content.

## What do I need to know about working with Tina Cloud during the beta?

Like most beta programs, there is a chance that you will occasionally run into a bug or need to update your code because of API improvements.

We will try our best to inform you of any service maintenance or API changes as soon as we can.

We think one of the best values of Tina Cloud is that it stores your content in your Git repository. You will always own and control your content files.
 
## Where do I start?

- Have a look at the updated [Tina Cloud docs](https://tina.io/beta-docs) -- note: these docs are different than our current public docs.
- The [Next.js starter](https://github.com/tinacms/tina-cloud-starter) implements the basic concepts of working with Tina Cloud.
- [Register your Tina Cloud organization!](https://auth.tina.io/register)

## What technical considerations should I make when working with Tina Cloud?

We think you'll find success with Tina Cloud if your project includes:

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** - The flexibility of this fantastic React framework lowers the bar to build with Tina Cloud.
- **GitHub** - The first Git provider that Tina Cloud integrates with. Other Git providers may be available in the future.
- **Static, file-based builds** - The Tina Cloud client collects your filesystem content at build time. The ability to fetch content from our cloud API during builds will come soon.

The [Next.js starter](https://github.com/tinacms/tina-cloud-starter) can get you up and running quickly with the above considerations. Give it a try and let us know how we can make developing with Tina easier.

## How can I share an idea or get help using Tina Cloud?

## What is the pricing for Tina Cloud?

There will be no cost for small teams to use Tina Cloud while it is in beta.

A fair use policy will be coming soon.

We will contact you if we believe your use case may eventually fit within our post-beta paid plans.
